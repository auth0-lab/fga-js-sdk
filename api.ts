     * The Check API queries to check if the user has a certain relationship with an object in a certain store. A `contextual_tuples` object may also be included in the body of the request. This object contains one field `tuple_keys`, which is an array of tuple keys. You may also provide an `authorization_model_id` in the body. This will be used to assert that the input `tuple_key` is valid for the model specified. If not specified, the assertion will be made against the latest authorization model ID. The response will return whether the relationship exists in the field `allowed`.  ## Example In order to check if user `user:anne` of type `user` has a `reader` relationship with object `document:2021-budget` given the following contextual tuple ```json {   \"user\": \"user:anne\",   \"relation\": \"member\",   \"object\": \"time_slot:office_hours\" } ``` the Check API can be used with the following request body: ```json {   \"tuple_key\": {     \"user\": \"user:anne\",     \"relation\": \"reader\",     \"object\": \"document:2021-budget\"   },   \"contextual_tuples\": {     \"tuple_keys\": [       {         \"user\": \"user:anne\",         \"relation\": \"member\",         \"object\": \"time_slot:office_hours\"       }     ]   } } ``` Auth0 FGA\'s response will include `{ \"allowed\": true }` if there is a relationship and `{ \"allowed\": false }` if there isn\'t.

  /**
     * The Expand API will return all users and usersets that have certain relationship with an object in a certain store. This is different from the `/stores/{store_id}/read` API in that both users and computed usersets are returned. Body parameters `tuple_key.object` and `tuple_key.relation` are all required. The response will return a tree whose leaves are the specific users and usersets. Union, intersection and difference operator are located in the intermediate nodes.  ## Example To expand all users that have the `reader` relationship with object `document:2021-budget`, use the Expand API with the following request body ```json {   \"tuple_key\": {     \"object\": \"document:2021-budget\",     \"relation\": \"reader\"   } } ``` Auth0 FGA\'s response will be a userset tree of the users and computed usersets that have read access to the document. ```json {   \"tree\":{     \"root\":{       \"type\":\"document:2021-budget#reader\",       \"union\":{         \"nodes\":[           {             \"type\":\"document:2021-budget#reader\",             \"leaf\":{               \"users\":{                 \"users\":[                   \"user:bob\"                 ]               }             }           },           {             \"type\":\"document:2021-budget#reader\",             \"leaf\":{               \"computed\":{                 \"userset\":\"document:2021-budget#writer\"               }             }           }         ]       }     }   } } ``` The caller can then call expand API for the `writer` relationship for the `document:2021-budget`.

     * The ListObjects API returns a list of all the objects of the given type that the user has a relation with. To achieve this, both the store tuples and the authorization model are used.

If it is not specified, the latest authorization model ID will be used. You may also specify `contextual_tuples` that will be treated as regular tuples. The response will contain the related objects in an array in the \"objects\" field of the response and they will be strings in the object format `<type>:<id>` (e.g. \"document:roadmap\")  ## Example In order to list the objects of type document that user `user:anne` has a `reader` relationship with, while passing the Anne is an editor of the marketing folder in the contextual tuples, You can issue a ListObjects API request that includes the contextual tuples: ```json {   \"authorization_model_id\": \"01G5JAVJ41T49E9TT3SKVS7X1J\",   \"user\": \"user:anne\",   \"relation\": \"reader\",   \"type\": \"document\"   \"contextual_tuples\": {     \"tuple_keys\": [       {         \"user\": \"user:anne\",         \"relation\": \"editor\",         \"object\": \"folder:marketing\"       }     ]   } } ``` Auth0 FGA\'s response will be of the format: `{ \"objects\": [\"document:roadmap\"] }` and include document Anne is related to as reader

  /**
     * The Read API will return the tuples for a certain store that match a query filter specified in the body of the request. It is different from the `/stores/{store_id}/expand` API in that it only returns relationship tuples that are stored in the system and satisfy the query.  In the body: 1. `tuple_key.object` is mandatory. It can be a full object (e.g., `type:object_id`) or type only (e.g., `type:`). 2. `tuple_key.user` is mandatory in the case the `tuple_key.object` is a type only. 3. `authorization_model_id` is optional. If specified, it will be used to assert that the input `tuple_key` is valid for the model specified. If not specified, the latest authorization model ID will be used.  ## Examples ### Query for all objects in a type definition To query for all objects that `user:bob` has `reader` relationship in the document type definition, call read API with body of ```json {  \"tuple_key\": {      \"user\": \"user:bob\",      \"relation\": \"reader\",      \"object\": \"document:\"   } } ``` The API will return tuples and an optional continuation token, something like ```json {   \"tuples\": [     {       \"key\": {         \"user\": \"user:bob\",         \"relation\": \"reader\",         \"object\": \"document:2021-budget\"       },       \"timestamp\": \"2021-10-06T15:32:11.128Z\"     }   ] } ``` This means that `user:bob` has a `reader` relationship with 1 document `document:2021-budget`. ### Query for all stored relationship tuples that have a particular relation and object To query for all users that have `reader` relationship with `document:2021-budget`, call read API with body of  ```json {   \"tuple_key\": {      \"object\": \"document:2021-budget\",      \"relation\": \"reader\"    } } ``` The API will return something like  ```json {   \"tuples\": [     {       \"key\": {         \"user\": \"user:bob\",         \"relation\": \"reader\",         \"object\": \"document:2021-budget\"       },       \"timestamp\": \"2021-10-06T15:32:11.128Z\"     }   ] } ``` This means that `document:2021-budget` has 1 `reader` (`user:bob`).  Note that the API will not return writers such as `user:anne` even when all writers are readers.  This is because only direct relationship are returned for the READ API. ### Query for all users with all relationships for a particular document To query for all users that have any relationship with `document:2021-budget`, call read API with body of  ```json {   \"tuple_key\": {       \"object\": \"document:2021-budget\"    } } ``` The API will return something like  ```json {   \"tuples\": [     {       \"key\": {         \"user\": \"user:anne\",         \"relation\": \"writer\",         \"object\": \"document:2021-budget\"       },       \"timestamp\": \"2021-10-05T13:42:12.356Z\"     },     {       \"key\": {         \"user\": \"user:bob\",         \"relation\": \"reader\",         \"object\": \"document:2021-budget\"       },       \"timestamp\": \"2021-10-06T15:32:11.128Z\"     }   ] } ``` This means that `document:2021-budget` has 1 `reader` (`user:bob`) and 1 `writer` (`user:anne`).

The API will return: ```json {   \"authorization_model\":{     \"id\":\"01G5JAVJ41T49E9TT3SKVS7X1J\",     \"type_definitions\":[       {         \"type\":\"user\"       },       {         \"type\":\"document\",         \"relations\":{           \"reader\":{             \"union\":{               \"child\":[                 {                   \"this\":{}                 },                 {                   \"computedUserset\":{                     \"object\":\"\",                     \"relation\":\"writer\"                   }                 }               ]             }           },           \"writer\":{             \"this\":{}           }         }       }     ]   } } ``` In the above example, there are 2 types (`user` and `document`).
